For other uses, seeCalendar.This is a list of calendars,dating systems, chronologies, etc. used inMagic: The Gathering. The infinite planes of the multiverse do not necessarily carry the same lengths of day, month, or year. However, years seem to pass between planes concurrently in-storyline, so a Ravnican year can be presumed to be the same length as a Dominarian year. Below is a conversion table of the known dates of some of the planes:InCridhethe years are given as they relate to theParting. The only other known date is that of theMending of the Clan Tree, in 520.[8]Dominarian years are 420 days long and are organized by most developed cultures into twelve months, each of 35-days.[9]Argivian Reckoning(AR) is the primary calendar used onDominaria(notably excepting the continent ofCorondor). It sets year 0 as the year in which bothUrzaandMishrawere born. It only came into use many years after the time of the Brothers and was used informally for several thousand years before an attempt was made to clarify historical facts. It is named afterNew Argive, a country famed for its scholars. The last time the date was explicitly mentioned, it was 4562 AR.[1]Common Era(CE) is a dating system established by New Sumifans inAlmaaz. It starts around 3035AR.[10]Penregon Founding, orPFfor short, is the only calendar system known to be in use at the time ofThe Brothers' War. It sets Year 0 as the yearPenregon, the capital ofArgive, was founded. WhenUrzaandMishrawere born (0AR), the year was 912 PF.TheReckoning of the Sages of Minoradis a calendar primarily used inCorondor. Year 1 in this reckoning begins on the anniversary of the gathering of theSages of Minorad. It corresponds with the year 3000 of theArgivian Reckoning.The various empires ofSarpadiahad their own systems of dating.[11]During the four months over whichFallen Empirestook place, these included:Dwarves of the Crimson Peaks: Second Day of the Moon of Snow's EndElves of Havenwood: Flowerfeast EveVodalian merfolk: Twelfth Tide of the Fifth MoonIcatia: Fifth Day of GothwinstideIcatia: Seventh Day of GothwinstideOrder of the Ebon Hand: Time of the Seventh SacrificeIcatia: Two days past AllfestCrimson Peaks: Fourteenth Day of the Moon of Cloudless SkiesDates on Innistrad are measured using the stages of the moon and the years since Avacyn's creation, commonly shortened to "Ava." There are three seasons on Innistrad: Harvest Moon (autumn), Hunter's Moon (winter), and New Moon (spring). It is unclear how long a season or a year on Innistrad lasts, although Hunter's Moon is said to be the longest and New Moon the shortest.[12]The latest dates known for each season in-lore are the 118th of Harvest Moon in the years of Avacyn 699 and 711, the 121st of Hunter's Moon, Ava. 718, and the 116th of New Moon, Ava. 714. If the seasons are consistent each year, this would make an Innistrad year roughly as long as an Earth year.[3]Kamigawauses numbered years, although they are not given a name and their start is unknown.[4]As the year 1053 occurred during the Age of Enlightenment, it is possible years are marked following theKami War. Kamigawan months are numbered, and there are at least ten of them. The eighth and ninth months have at least 29 days. Dates are recorded as a string with the two-digit month followed by a two-digit day, a period, and the year (e.g. the first day of the eighth month of 1053 was 0801.1053). Time is recorded in 24-hour notation.The months ofKephalaiare numbered, up to at least Eighthmonth.[13]OnMirrodin, time is recorded by the cycles of the five suns, although it is not clear how much time passes within each cycle. In the novelThe Moons of Mirrodin, it is stated that the levelers attack every 100 cycles, whilethe flavor text of the card itselfstates that this event occurs every century, possibly demonstrating that a cycle is simply another term for a year. Every 100 cycles, at a time called "the convergence," the four suns either aligned above their lands[14]or came into alignment with each other.[15]Kiryk's field reports just before his capture andcompleationrange from 3rd cycle of the Blue sun, 10th periodic, 5th locus to 6th cycle, 5th periodic, 15th locus. There are at least 16 periodics and 15 loci in a cycle.[5]After the plane's Phyrexianization,Jin-Gitaxias's Progress Engine recorded dates in numeric sequences, although it is unclear what they denote.Unctus's field reports from after his compleation range from 100-23-200239.6 to 100-23-229723.3.[5]InPlaneswalker,Xantchastates that Phyrexians use days, seasons, and years, but she does not understand "months." Overall, she states that Phyrexia was a place where time "went unmeasured."[16]Ravnica uses the measure ofAl ConcordantandZal Concordant.Al Concordantis used to measure the time before the signing of theGuildpact, whileZal Concordantis used afterward. The events ofReturn to Ravnica blocktake place in 10,075 ZC, and the Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica depicts Ravnica beforeGuilds of Ravnica blockin the year 10,076 ZC, commonly referred to as ’76.Ravnica’s calendar contains 365 days divided into twelve months, with the same number of days as the Gregorian calendar.[6]The year begins with 1 Seleszeni (March 1). The annual celebration of the Guildpact begins on 28 Zuun and extends into 1 Seleszeni.Seleszeni or Orzabin[17](March)Dhazo[18](April)Prahz[18]or Prazh[17](May)Mokosh[18](June)Paujal (July)Cizarm (August)Tevnember (September)Golgar (October)Quaegar (November)Xivaskir (December)Griev (January)Zuun (February)Main article:Theros (plane)#Meletian CalendarAlthough the method of marking years onTherosis unknown,Meletishas developed a calendar that has been at least partially adopted in the poleis ofAkrosandSetessa. The calendar is composed of 12 months, each beginning with the new moon, alternating between 30 and 29 days, and named after a festival celebrated during that month. Roughly every three years, an extra 30-day month is added to the end of the year, giving Theros a 364-day year, meaning its years are likely the same length as on Earth.[7]LyokymionProtokynionAstrapionPolidrysionThriambion (Meletis) and Iroagonion (Akros)MegasphagionChalcanapsionNecrologionTherimakarionKatabasionCheimazionAgrypnionAnagrypnion (occurs every three years)
